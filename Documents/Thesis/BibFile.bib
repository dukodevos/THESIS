abstract = {The aim of this study is to estimate monetary abatement values for road and rail traffic noise that can be used for policy purposes. However, a main objective is to critically discuss the assumptions necessary to convert the monetary values elicited in willingness to pay (WTP) studies to values than can be use for policy purposes. The authors employ the hedonic regression technique on Swedish data to elicit individuals\^{a}€™ preferences for noise abatement. The elicited values are then converted to policy values and critically examined based on findings from a literature review. The authors show that WTP for road and rail not only differs in levels but also that the relationship between the noise level and the marginal value differs between the two sources. They also show that a health cost component added to the WTP estimate, based on the assumption of uninformed property buyers, will be small but not negligible and that also modest differences in the assumption of the discount rates will have a significant effect on the estimated values. The main implications from this study are: (i) WTP for road and railway noise abatement differs not only on absolute but also marginal levels, (ii) Even small differences in the chosen discount rate, which is necessary to convert WTP values from a hedonic price study to policy values, have large effects on the policy values, and (iii) the authors show how to add a health cost component to the WTP estimates in order for the monetary estimates to reflect the total social cost. However, they argue that the motivation for doing so is weak and that more research is needed on this issue.},

abstract = {Using a two-stage hedonic pricing methodology we estimate a system of struc- tural demand equations for different sources of transport-related noise. In the first stage, we identifymarket segments using model-based clustering techniques and estimate separate hedonic price functions (HPFs) for each segment. In so doing, we show how a semipara- metric spatial smoothing estimator outperforms other standard specifications of the HPF. In the second stage, we control for non-linearity of the budget constraint and identify demand relationships using techniques that account for problems of endogeneity and censoring of the dependent variable.Our estimated demand functions provide welfare estimates for peace and quiet that we believe to be the first derived from property market data in a theoretically consistent manner.},

abstract = {Because of large planned infrastructual projects like expansion of the main airport and construction of high-speed railways, noise nuisance has become a national social topic in the Netherlands. Moreover, according to EU-guidelines, determination and enforcement of differentiated noise limits will be delegated from national to local governments in the near future. The value of noise has never been this important. In this paper, we estimate the non-linear impact of traffic noise on property prices. The used data set is very extensive, over 100,000 sales transactions are studied, with many individual property characteristics, combined with noise levels for 2 million small 100 by 100m areas. We use spatial autocorrelation techniques to overcome regular problems of tranditional NIMBY-analysis performed by hedonic regression. In a rising market, we find that the impact of traffic noise ranges to 12 percent, with an average of about 5 percetn. The discount varies across sub-markets, and is a non-linear function of the noise level.},
